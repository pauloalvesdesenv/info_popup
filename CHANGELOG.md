- fix: Issue where InfoPopupWidget was not updating when a state inside it changed, whether it was active or closed, has been resolved.
- fix: Problem of closing when clicked while active on top of InfoPopupWidget and automatically reopening has been fixed.

#### Breaking Change: 
The customContent prop should now be a function that returns a Widget instead of directly accepting a Widget.

Previous usage: `customContent: Widget`

New usage: `customContent: () => Widget`

This change means that the `customContent` prop must now be a function, requiring adjustments in the existing codebase.
